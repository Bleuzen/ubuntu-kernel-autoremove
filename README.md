# Version overview

### v1

This was my initial version and marks kernels as automatically installed once a week. It does not handle automatic uninstall.

Install:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bleuzen/ubuntu-kernel-autoremove.git
cd ubuntu-kernel-autoremove/v1/
bash install.sh
```


### v2

This is a customized version by @mmikowski which marks kernels as auto installed after every apt transaction.

Install:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bleuzen/ubuntu-kernel-autoremove.git
cd ubuntu-kernel-autoremove/v2/
bash install.sh
```
